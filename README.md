# 🌑 Umbra Engine

**Umbra** is a modern, open-source, data-driven game engine written in Go, focused on simplicity, clarity, and cross-platform development.  
It is designed for both **2D and 3D games**, supports **macOS, Linux, and Windows**, and aims to be fully programmable in Go.

> _Umbra_ (noun): The fully shaded inner region of a shadow cast by an opaque object — a fitting name for an engine built to bring light and motion to games.

## 🚀 Vision

Umbra aims to provide a developer-friendly engine with the following principles:

- **Cross-platform**: Runs natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Data-driven**: Scene structure and objects are defined using human-readable `.scene` files (YAML).
- **Go-powered**: Write your entire game logic in Go, with potential for scripting extensions (e.g., Lua).
- **Low-poly & shader-ready**: Built for stylized visuals, from 2D pixel scenes to modern low-poly 3D.
- **Modular & Extensible**: Future support for plugins, custom components, and in-editor tooling.
